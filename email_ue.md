Dear Sir or Madam,
Dear Member of Parliament,

I am writing to you regarding the subject of deep sea mining. As you know, the United Nation Ocean Conference is currently taking place in Lisbon, Portugal. Monday 27th of June, an international alliance of members of parliament (national and European) took a stance to support a moratorium. As a citizen and a voter, I'd like to ask you to join this movement. The stakes are high, and time is of the essence.

The deep ocean is not only a reservoir of biodiversity that we are just starting to discover and to understand. It is also the primary regulator of our climate: it stores around 38% of all greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere every year [1] and absorbs 93% of the heat surplus induced by human activities [2]. The ocean is our greatest ally to achieve our climate goals.

Against the rising interest of industrial groups to extract rare minerals (such as cobalt, copper, manganese or nickel) found in abyssal ecosystems, scientists have called for a moratorium on deep seabed mining, for the following reasons:

Our current state of knowledge on the deep sea is not sufficient to allow its exploitation: 80% of the deep ocean remains unexplored. We know more about the Moon's surface than we do about the depths of our oceans[3];

We must apply the precautionary principle until we have enough information on the extent of the irreversible impacts that exploitation could have on a global scale - such as the destruction of biodiversity, or the release of carbon captured in ocean sediments for thousands of years [4];

The oceans are the most important carbon sink of our planet and give us a significant advantage to respect the Paris Agreement climate targets. That is why we need to preserve the deep ocean.

We need to ensure a transparent, inclusive and representative decision-making process, especially for local communities who will experience disproportionate impacts from this industry. This is currently not the case given the International Seabed Authority’s (ISA) decision-making process. [5]

Yesterday, an Alliance of Countries in favour of a Moratorium on Deep Sea Mining led by the governments of New Zealand and Palau was announced at the United Nations Ocean Conference.

Today, MPs from all over the world are committed to support this international moratorium, and invite all their parliamentary colleagues to join them.

While a growing number of countries are joining the scientists' call for a moratorium [6], other countries like France are not taking a stand. This is why we are reaching out to you: we ask you to listen to the scientists and to propose a law establishing a moratorium on deep sea mining, in your country’s territorial waters as well as in the high seas.

France represents the world's second largest maritime space: we have a historical responsibility to set conditions for the issue of the first deep ocean exploitation permits, which could start in June 2023 [7].

We are counting on you to preserve the deep ocean and its invaluable role in stabilising our global climate. At the end of this email, you will find several sources to learn more about these issues. We are at your disposal should you need any further information and we thank you in advance for your consideration.

I hope that you will have the political courage to make this brave and necessary decision and I hope to find your name in the list of signatures.

[6] - Several states have taken a stance, such as New Zealand, Fiji, Palau and the State of Washington in the United States. During the World Conservation Congress last September, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy also took a stand by banning these practices in their territorial waters.
[7] - According to the rules of the International Seabed Authority, the stages of deep sea mining will start in June 2023 because of the so-called "Two-Years Trigger Rule", giving mining companies two years to define the mining code that will govern their own practices, was set in motion last year.
